      RedX Movie 9 is a small ReactJS project that allows users to search for movies and display their information. The project utilizes the OMDB API to fetch movie data based on the user's search term. It features a clean and intuitive user interface with a search bar where users can enter the movie title they want to search for. Upon entering a search term, the application retrieves movie results from the API and dynamically renders movie cards displaying the movie's title, year of release, poster image, and type. Users can easily browse through the search results and explore different movies. RedX Movie 9 demonstrates the fundamental concepts of ReactJS, including component rendering, state management, API integration, and event handling."
